# Description
Our game will be a rhythm-based title developed for mobile platforms, utilizing a 4-lane note system as the foundation for gameplay. Players will interact with falling notes that appear in sync with a song's BGM (background music), which serves as the basis for each handcrafted note map. These maps are fixed in design, encouraging players to improve through repetition and muscle memory as they learn each song's rhythm and structure. Notes will come in standard tap and hold formats—single notes requiring quick taps, and long notes needing sustained input—both tailored for touch controls, with possible additions. The core interaction model revolves around the player physically tapping and holding the screen with their fingers, which serves as a core gameplay mechanic and the game’s "X-Factor," setting it apart from other rhythm game formats.

Gameplay is designed to be both engaging and responsive, offering a smooth feedback loop that rewards precision while providing visual and audio cues to reinforce accuracy. A dynamic combo and scoring system tracks the player’s performance, assigning ratings like Perfect, Good, or Ok based on timing accuracy. The mobile platform introduces an added layer of immediacy and immersion, as all input is handled through touch gestures without external controllers. This opens the possibility for additional mechanics such as directional swipes in a quick time event for more complex note patterns and complexity in future iterations. Each song's difficulty scales with its BPM and note layout, creating a progression curve that balances challenge with learnability.

The win condition is straightforward: players must reach the end of a song without missing too many notes. While some leniency is allowed—through feedback grades like Good or Ok but completely missing notes consecutively in a row will gradually lead to failure. This creates a tension curve where the player must maintain rhythm and precision, especially in longer or faster tracks. As development continues, additional conditions such as minimum score thresholds or combo requirements may be introduced to diversify challenge modes. The goal is to create a mobile rhythm game that feels tight, expressive, and satisfying to replay.
